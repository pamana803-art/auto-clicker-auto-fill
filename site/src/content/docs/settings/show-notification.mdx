Additional Options:

- **Silent Mode**: Show notifications without sound.
- **Sound Alerts**: Play a sound with notifications.
- **Discord Integration**: Connect the extension to a Discord server. When enabled:
  - Notifications (e.g., action complete, batch complete, errors) are sent to the user's Discord account.
  - Users must be part of the same Discord server and allow direct messages from server members.

<Callout type="warning">
  ! Important Enable notifications while configuring to catch errors quickly (e.g., missing/wrong XPath). You can turn
  them off once your setup is stable.
